# Triaging:

## What, why:

There are a lot of effectively obsolete pages at the App.net Wiki - [http://appdotnetwiki.net/](http://appdotnetwiki.net/) - some in need of explicit instructions for new viewers, others requiring edits to bring them up-to-date.

## How:

I'm never ever in favour of deletions, *hate* broken links; we should simply work around them.  But that's only my opinion.

Some time ago I put together a style guide, attempting to create a uniform look for the Wiki.  It's here: [http://appdotnetwiki.net/w/index.php?title=Help:Editing](http://appdotnetwiki.net/w/index.php?title=Help:Editing).

It has 2 sections I think may be appropriate in a make-over…

## Categories \*and\* Banners:

### [Categories:](http://appdotnetwiki.net/w/index.php?title=Help:Editing#Categories)

Categories should be added to pages to indicate status: either 'obsolete' or 'in need of enhancement.'  The listings will be brought together on two temporary pages, ready for action.

### [Banners:](http://appdotnetwiki.net/w/index.php?title=Help:Editing#Banners)

I think we can use Banners to alert viewers that pages are obsolete, even perhaps in need of work - the latter hopefully a temporary situation.

Add banners at the top of pages, for example looking like:

* "| ! | Obsoleted |" or
* "| ? | Needs work |"

Simple.

The Felix page is a special example of a banner-ed page: [http://appdotnetwiki.net/w/index.php?title=Felix](http://appdotnetwiki.net/w/index.php?title=Felix).

# Obsoleting:

## How to choose?

### Slash & burn?

It's a trivial thing to display all the Wiki's pages: [http://appdotnetwiki.net/w/index.php?title=Special:AllPages](http://appdotnetwiki.net/w/index.php?title=Special:AllPages).

What's **not** trivial; deciding what to do, which pages aren't current.

The list, though quite large, should be able to have a quick and productive early run-through; App and Patter rooms' pages account for a good proportion of the total.

The great thing about Wikis; the number of tools available to classify pages means nothing gets left behind - even [orphaned pages](http://appdotnetwiki.net/w/index.php?title=Special:LonelyPages) are listable.

Adding banners and defining categories to obsolete content then removing links on calling pages seems the easiest way to hide stuff.

## What should be removed?

### Main page:

* Remove ADNmeetup & Featured activities - unfortunately stale,
* Remove Glossary, History, Threading, Timeline, Vernacular - as having scant or trivial content.

## What should be reworked?

### Linked from the main page:

* Resources for new users - e.g. its first link is dead.
